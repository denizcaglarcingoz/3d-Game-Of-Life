3D Version of Conway's Game Of Life

The rules are simple:

A cubes life depends on its neighbours.

One cube on 3d environment has 26 neighbours.

It can stay alive if it has 2 or 3 alive neighbours.

If it is less than 2, it dies because there is not enough neighbour.
If it is more than 3, it dies because there is overpopulation.

The dead cubes can became alive if 3 neighbour of the dead is alive.
Not 4!  Not 2! only 3.
